<p dir="ltr">Nina slipped in a pool and smashed out her front teeth while on holiday in Turkey. As a result she had extensive dental surgery. The trauma to the front of the skull has resulted in a protective muscle guarding and splinting, similar to what happens in a whiplash injury. Nina had suffered with pain for more than a year.  After four treatments the headaches and jaw pain were considerably reduced.  We now have Nina on a three weekly maintenance treatment.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><em>I am an integrative medical doctor and I always send my patients to Isaac for their musculoskeletal adjustments.  Isaac is the best in his field, able to work magic on my patients who have suffered for years with aches and pains.  I wouldn’t send my patients anywhere else for their adjustments!  I have seen Isaac for my own muscular complaints, and the results were extraordinary- I was free of muscle pain and feeling light on my feet!  His personality is warm and quietly intelligent- he is built like a lumberjack, but with the personality of a teddy bear and the brain of a scientist.  The perfect combination.  I look forward to sending my patients to Isaac, with the confidence in knowing he will look after them well.  </em><strong>Dr Kathleen Wills, (I)MD, Doctor of Integrative Medicine (USA/NZ), Clinical Nutritionist, GM Australasian Integrative Medicine Association</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">After falling over while running two or three times she presented with a stabbing pain in the lower back and found it hard to put on her socks. The pain was also present after standing for just a short period of time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mandy had been to physio and had massage but with little to no results. After just three visits she was able to stand without pain and was also able to return to her much loved running program.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><em>A treatment with Isaac is no ordinary massage - I find the adjustments he makes are far more therapeutic and effective than regular soft tissue work. For years I have had monthly massages, and would make an appointment each time I started to get tension headaches, migraines and sore neck and shoulders. By seeing Isaac regularly, I no longer experience these symptoms and my posture and general wellbeing have significantly improved. The work he does really works!</em>  <strong>Kate Ashcroft</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">On examination I noted that the muscles in her back and neck were extremely tight. This could have been a result of standing all day at the cafe and twisting while playing golf.  That evening Fleur was able to attend the seminar and the tension was considerably reduced.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fleur is now a regular client and is able to maintain an excellent game of golf.</p>
