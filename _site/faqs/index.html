<h3>Q.  Why is massage good for me?</h3>

<p>The short answer is, it makes you feel better!</p>

<p>The scientific answer is a bit longer... Whenever a person spends any length of time in a sustained posture or performing similar movements, muscular tone is increased and with increased muscular tone comes decreased blood flow and drainage of lymph (fluid that is not blood). As a result pain signals can be triggered causing the aches and pains we all experience from time to time. With injury this increase in tone is far greater, widespread and longer lasting.</p>

<p>Massage and manual manipulation attempts to restore healthy fluid dynamics to the tissues. When the fluid dynamics are improved so are the supply of nutrients and oxygen as well as the movement of metabolic waste products that can build up in the tissues.</p>

<p>Stimulation of tissues = improved fluid dynamics = healthy tissues and restored functionality, or massage = body feels good.</p>

<h3>Q.  Will just one massage be enough?</h3>

<p>It always depends on the person and how long the condition has been there.  The longer standing the condition the more treatments may be necessary, but most of my clients see me once a month or more.</p>

<h3>Q.  Do your treatments hurt?</h3>

<p>It is necessary for best results to apply a certain amount of pressure to the tissues. If you are excessively tight or restricted in movement a small to medium level of discomfort is to be expected at various stages of the treatment, but I will ask you how it is feeling and adjust as necessary.</p>

<h3>Q.  Do I have to take off all my clothes to get a massage?</h3>

<p>In most cases you are required to remove all clothing down to your underwear. However you will be covered by a towel the whole time.  If you do not feel comfortable removing clothing, it is usually possible to treat using pressure through the clothing.</p>

<h3>Q.  Is there anything special I need to do before a massage?  Or after?</h3>

<p>It is important to keep your water intake up before and after a massage. The reason is that we are usually dealing with a dysfunctional fluid flow and the intention of a treatment is to restore fluid dynamics therefore drinking water before and after a treatment is an essential part of the treatment process.
It is also important to avoid alcohol, coffee, and energy drinks after a treatment as these are diuretics and will encourage your body to get rid of the much needed water in the tissues.
It’s a good idea to drink lots of water for the rest of the day to help flush the toxins out of the system too.  When you come and see me, I’ll also give you some self help tips, which include things like stretches and specific exercises to work on your particular trouble area.  You will be feeling better in no time!</p>

<h3>Q.  I’ve got sensitive skin.  Will your massage oil irritate my skin?</h3>

<p>The oil I use is high quality and does not cause a reaction for most people. However I can do most of the techniques without oil, using pressure and gentle stretching.</p>
